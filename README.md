## About the Project

We will be making a simple **racing simulation game**. By simulation, I don't mean first-person simulation games like _Euro Truck Simulator_, but rather decision-making simulation games like _The Sims_ or _Football Manager_.

## About the Game
The player controls a sports car racer. This is not a racing game, i.e. the player doesn't control the racer during a race. Instead, the player has control over the racer's decisions: which car to buy, which equipment to install or upgrade, which skills to train, which technicians to hire, which tournaments to compete in and using which car, etc. The game is essentially about making smart decisions to eventually become a successful racer.

### Interface
Below is a preview of how the home screen might look:

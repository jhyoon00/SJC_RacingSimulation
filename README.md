# Racing Simulation Game

## About the Project

We will be making a simple **racing simulation game**. By simulation, we don't mean first-person simulation games like _Euro Truck Simulator_, but rather decision-making simulation games like _The Sims_ or _Football Manager_.

## About the Game
The player controls a sports car racer. This is not a racing game, i.e. the player doesn't control the racer during a race. Instead, the player has control over the racer's decisions: which car to buy, which equipment to install or upgrade, which skills to train, which technicians to hire, which tournaments to compete in and using which car, etc. The game is essentially about making smart decisions to eventually become a successful racer.

### Interface
Below is a preview of how the home screen might look once the game is complete:
![interface outline](https://github.com/jhyoon00/SJC_RacingSimulation/assets/77221627/ada529c2-031f-470e-acc0-20148cde1393)
The sections highlighted in _YELLOW_ are in-game **objects**. The sections highlighted in _GREEN_ are **actions**, meaning clicking them will allow the player to interact, such as entering a new window.

### Objects
Some objects shown in the home screen include:
- **Name:** Player name (racer's name)
- **Info & traits:** Player information (age, world ranking, market value, etc.) and player traits (skills)
- **Money:** How much money the player currently has
- **Date:** In-game date
- **Menu:** This bar shows some of the actions that the player can do.
- **Current selected car:** Shows the current selected car
- **Sponsor:** Shows current sponsor(s)
- **Car info:** Basic car info, speed, etc.

### Actions
The actions available in the home screen are the following:
- **Weekly Calendar:** Shows current schedule for week. Clicking the bar brings player to a **Monthly Calendar** window.
- **Achievements:** Shows a simplified list of achievements. Clicking the bar brings player to a more extensive **Achievements** window.
- **Continue:** Clicking the bar skips forward in time until there is a new available event.
- **Office:** Clicking the bar brings player to the **Office** window, where the player can deal with contract matters with sponsors, technician team, and make other business-related actions.
- **Garage:** Clicking the bar brings player to the **Garage** window, where the player can change cars, purchase new cars, purchase/install/upgrade equipment, etc.
- **Tournaments:** Clicking the bar brings player to the **Tournaments** window. where the player can view and register for upcoming tournaments.
- **Training Track:** Clicking the bar brings player to the **Training Track** window, where the player can train to improve skills.
- **Settings:** Clicking the bar brings player to the **Settings** window, where the player can change settings regarding interface, sound, etc.


## About the Tasks
We will obviously begin with a more simplified version of the game, and build upon it by adding more interesting features later on.

**Procedure**
1. Create a text-based, simpler version of the game with minimal actions and objects
2. Create visual interface
3. Add more objects and actions to improve game



## Responsibilites and Work Distribution
For now, we are looking to use python's pygame library to code. JH will write most of the main.py file. There will be many functions available for you to write, so feel free to take responsibility to write some of them. However, make sure you know what you are doing, and also make sure you write a lot of comments so others can read your code! <br>

Most of the work will be divided into two types: **Interface Design** and **Game Logic**. <br>

### Responsibilities
| Interface Design | Game Logic |
| -------- | -------- |
| JH | JH |
| DH | DH |
| Sudikshya | Sudikshya |
| Figo | Figo |

<br>
Good luck!
